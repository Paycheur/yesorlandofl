            The Portfolio Group Is A 21st CENTURY Boutique Real Estate Firm!
            We built this brand specifically to get the attention of Today's Advanced Consumer, that consumer that has evolved beyond how we used to conduct business in years and decades past, and for those consumers who have come to the realization that the big box agencies aren't paying attention to the details of their lives, nor how their tastes their moods their needs have changed and evolved over time.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-justify">

            Thanks to the unyielding innovation and dedication of our founders and our team, we are empowered to constantly elevate the overall Real Estate Experience to a new level while staying true to the fundamentals that this industry was built on.

            </p>

            <p class="txt-justify">
            We believe more is required of today’s Real Estate firms in the sense that consumers should be able to have access to the industry's top talent, top tech, top data, regardless of the type of Real Estate transaction they might be involved in. Reality tells us every consumer is affected by multiple classes of real estate whether Residential, Commercial, or Investment. Therefore we’ve built the Portfolio Group as an “Everything Real Estate Group” meaning regardless of the type or Real Estate our clients are interested we can effectively & successfully guide them through the transaction.

            <p class="txt-justify">
              Is to create New Rules in the Real Estate industry. While we respect old rules, we feel as though there can be new & improved ways to do things. Sometimes old ways trump innovation and freshness. We feel that every component of our business needs to be looked at carefully and studied to see how it can constantly be improved and we feel as though we always have to be asking ourselves how can we make this component or idea better!
